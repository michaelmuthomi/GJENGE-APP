      "Gjenge is a community-focused enterprise addressing the need for sustainable, affordable building materials in Kenya and Africa. We innovate by transforming recycled plastics into paving blocks, tiles, and manhole covers. Initially, we aimed to collect and sell plastic waste but quickly shifted to creating value-added products when recycling companies couldn't keep up with the supply. This led to the founding of Gjenge Makers.",
